- 2-3 pages (sort half-way between poster/paper)
    - outline
    - process/algorithm
    - what's hoped to achieve
    - expectations of what could result in.
    - better than brain dump, not yet real paper

- Add index.html to each test directory with links to every test and
  original tests, first failing test, shrink tests, and final shurnk
  test case labelled.
    - black/red for passing/failing
    - also, notate which browsers failed threshold
- Think about how to generate stylesheet/CSS in parallel with HTML
  elements as they are generated (and store the CSS in separate
  section or in a file).

* Add images to the random generators.
    * Add gen/static/ directory with images
- Add inline CSS that does real styling (not just pure random).
- Add something that servo does not support yet to the generators.

- More browser engines (Edge, Safari, mobile?)
- Pair-wise compare for the final failing case...

- Use test-check 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT

- Label shrink files
    - filename using hooked reporter function (:??)
    - gen/UUID/shrink_10.png
* Expand each image height and width to greatest height/width and fill
  with the empty color.
* Get servo working on laptop/headless for testing.
* Normalize images in separate function before working with them
* Implement SSD comparison algorithm
* Each trial in a separate directory within gen
    * filename using hooked reporter function (:trial)
    * gen/UUID/trial_1.png
